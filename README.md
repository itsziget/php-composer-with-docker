# Using PHP Composer with Docker

Some years ago I was mainly a PHP developer and I used Composer all the time.
When I started working with Docker, it became harder to use Composer.
I had some solution for different scenarios, but I often forgot what solution worked for what kind of projects.
I decided to create simple examples for me, and for you who are reading this readme.

This project is just started. More description and probably examples will come soon.
